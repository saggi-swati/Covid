- All countries data: https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries?yesterday&sort=cases
- Country specific data: https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries/<i>{country name}</i>

#### TODO:
This application aims to build features further -
* Provide more detailed global and country specific information regarding COVID-19
* Enable complete article rather than just the short stories.
* Allow information about the last updated.

Note: Since the end points are open APIs, major drawback is the apis and data couldn't be controlled. 
There is a plan to setup a separate endpoint to provide latest and more accurate data.
